            <h2>The Journey</h2>
            <p>As a kid, I wanted to be an olympic gymnast, a lawyer, and a broadway star. As time went on, I thought maybe I’d be a teacher, an event planner, or even the CEO of a symphony. Big dreams, all over the map.</p>
            <p>When I look back, I can remember exactly why I wanted to do each of these things. Sometimes, it was because I wanted to entertain or be creative. Other times, I wanted to help people and make a difference in their lives. </p>
            <p>In each new job I tried, I found myself taking on creative responsibilities that weren’t always in my job description. I enjoyed doing those things, but it made me realize something was missing.</p>

    <!-- The Spark color section -->
    <section>
        <h1>The Spark</h1>
        <p>In late 2017, I became engaged to my now husband. He had just enrolled in a coding bootcamp to become a software engineer, and when we decided to have a wedding website for our guests, he suggested we try to build it ourselves. Neither of us had
            ever done anything like that before, but we gave it a try. </p>
        <p>To our surprise, we pieced together something that we were actually pretty proud of.</p>
        <p>Designing that wedding website was the spark I needed to rethink my career. I wanted to learn more about the people who got to do this in real life, and that’s when I discovered Product Design. I felt like I found the holy grail: an opportunity
            to be creative and help people, dig into the technology we use every day, and understand how to make it better.</p>
        <p>I quit the job I wasn’t thrilled about, signed up for Bloc’s Product Design program, and here we are.</p>

    <!-- The Why color section -->
    <section>
        <h1>The Why</h1>
        <p>So what do I love about product design? Every day, I learn something new. I love building something from scratch and producing real solutions for real people. I love figuring out why something didn’t work and learning from those mistakes. I love
            the opportunity we have to impact people’s lives through great design, which is so much more than a beautiful interface.</p>
        <p><strong>And, I get &ast;really&ast; excited about usability tests.</strong></p>
