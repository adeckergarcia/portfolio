            <h1>Problem</h1>
            <p>With so many cloud storage platforms on the market, cloud storage users are frustrated when they have to navigate between several cloud drives to find the file they are looking for.</p>
            <h1>Solution</h1>
            <p>Cirrus brings all of a user’s cloud drives into one easy to access location. The user can search across all drives, upload files to a specific drive, share files, and edit files in the native platform, removing the need to navigate back and
                forth between drives.</p>

            <h1>Discovery</h1>
            <p>This client was looking to break into the cloud storage market. But with so many big players in the game, they knew that recreating the wheel wouldn’t be the right approach. After completing user research, a new problem came to light: users
                wish they could connect their existing cloud platforms.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h1>User Research</h1>
            <img src="/graph.png" alt="User Research Results">
            <p>The majority of current cloud storage users had 4 or more different cloud drives each. Their most used platform was Google Drive, followed by Dropbox and iCloud.</p>
            <p>The majority (94%) of these users rely on both mobile devices and laptop computers to access their storage.</p>

            <h2>Most Used Features</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Saving files and folders</li>
                <li>Sharing content with others</li>

                <li>Saving links, photos, or videos from the web</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Biggest Pain Point</h2>
            <p>When the respondents were asked, “Are there any features you wish your cloud storage platform(s) had or wish you could improve?”</p>
            <blockquote>I want easier connectivity with my other cloud storage!</blockquote>
            <p>30% of respondents wanted to connect existing cloud platforms so all user files would be easy to access from one place.</p>
            <p>The majority (53%) of respondents said they would be likely or very likely to use a cloud aggregator.</p>

            <p>She uses one cloud storage app to back up her photos, another to do her journaling so she can travel light, and she uses yet another app to save articles and funny videos she finds while she’s waiting for her next train or plane.</p>

            <h1>Usability Testing</h1>
            <p>A clickable prototype was created from the digital wireframes, and tested with users before going too far down any design path. Users were given three tasks to complete: creating an account, uploading a file, and organizing that file into
                a different folder.</p>
            <p>This round of testing helped me realize that because some of the users weren’t familiar with cloud storage apps, they also weren’t familiar with common design patterns used such as the Material Design Floating Action Button (FAB).</p>
            <p>During the desktop test, users weren’t confident about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Where the sidebar navigation links would take them and where they currently were</li>
                <li>What the FAB was for</li>
                <li>What the tridot button was for</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After this feedback, I was able to rethink components and make them more clear to the users.</p>

            <!-- Desktop changes -->
            <h2>Desktop Changes</h2>
            <p><strong>FAB: </strong>Move into sidebar and add label</p>

        <!-- Branding -->
        <section>
            <h1>Branding</h1>
            <p>The users of this app will be looking for an easy, intuitive experience. I wanted the brand to convey a clean, modern, and friendly atmosphere to help the user feel calm, focused, and productive.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Branding selections -->
        <section>
            <h1>Cirrus</h1>
            <p>The name Cirrus was chosen because cirrus clouds are the highest group of clouds, representing the app as an all-encompassing cloud drive aggregator.</p>
            <img src="/moodboard.png" alt="Cirrus Inspiration Moodboard">
            <p>A moodboard helped me gather inspiration for brand colors and feelings</p>

            <h1>Typography</h1>
            <img src="/brandfonts.png" alt="Cirrus Brand Fonts">
            <p>Poppins and Avenir were chosen for the fun and friendly, rounded nature.</p>

            <h1>Colors</h1>
            <img src="/color-palette.png" alt="Cirrus Color Palette">
            <p>The brand colors were selected for their meanings: coral for creativity and energy; teal for calmness and focus; lavender for calmness and creativity.</p>

            <h1>Logo Sketches</h1>
            <img src="/logo-sketches" alt="Cirrus Logo Sketches">
            <p>Early sketches of logo designs</p>
            <p>I knew that I wanted this logo to show users that this is a cloud related app and also express connectivity, so I chose my final design based on this idea.</p>

            <h1>Final Logo</h1>
            <img src="/cirrus-logo-bw.png" alt="Cirrus Logo in Black">
            <img src="/cirrus-logo-color" alt="Cirrus Logo in Brand Colors">
            <p>The final logomark is created from several circles that connect together to form a cloud, mirroring how the app will connect user drives to create one cohesive experience. The cloud shape is not that of a traditional Cirrus cloud, but gives
                a nod to the symbol traditionally used for cloud-based apps.</p>

                <img src="/mobile-dash-wireframe.png" alt="Mobile Dashboard Wireframe">
            </div>
            <p>The new user dashboard shows the user which cloud drives they have connected and gives them an easy way to add more. The new tab bar navigation allows them to easily switch back and forth between the Dashboard and All Files view.</p>

            <!-- Desktop design -->
            <h1>Desktop</h1>

            </div>
            <p>Updating the FAB and Options buttons to have a text label helps users to better understand what they will do and allow them to more easily complete their desired tasks. The updated navigation indicators show much more clearly where a user
                is located.</p>

        <section>
            <h1>Usability Testing</h1>
            <p>A new group of users was recruited and given the same tasks as the first group: creating an account, uploading a file, and organizing that file into a different folder. This group was also asked branding questions to determine what the design
                choices communicated.</p>
            <p>The new Options button worked much better for users than the original tridot menu on mobile.</p>
            <img src="/options-button-light.png" alt="Options Button on Desktop with Light Theme">
            <p>The new Options button on desktop was much more successful than the tridot menu</p>
            <p>However, there was still some confusion about whether the “Add New” button would add a new file or add a new cloud drive.</p>
            <img src="/desktop-fab-zoom.png" alt="Close up of Desktop Floating Action Button">
            <p>The "Add New" button on desktop still wasn't clear to some users</p>
            <p>The new "Add" button next to the Connected Drives section was confused for the FAB when a user was asked to upload a new file.</p>

            <!-- Mobile designs horizontal scroll section -->
            <h2>Mobile</h2>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <img src="/mobile-dash-v2.png" alt="Mobile Dashboard High Fidelity Version 2">
                    <p>High Fidelity Version 2</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src="/mobile-dash-v1.png" alt="Mobile Dashboard High Fidelity Version 1">
                    <p>High Fidelity Version 1</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src="/mobile-dash-wireframe.png" alt="Mobile Dashboard Wireframe">
                    <p>Original Wireframe</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The Connected Drives section on mobile was updated to be more similar to the desktop version. Adding the “Add New Drive” button and grouping it with the other connected drives prevents the user from confusing it with the FAB.</p>

            <!-- Desktop designs horizontal scroll section -->
            <h2>Desktop</h2>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <img src="/desktop-dash-v2-fab.png" alt="Desktop Dashboard Floating Action Button Version 3">
                    <p>High Fidelity Version 2</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src="/desktop-dash-v2-opt.png" alt="Desktop Dashboard Options Button Version 3">
                    <p>High Fidelity Version 1</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src="/desktop-dash-v1-fab.png" alt="Desktop Dashboard Floating Action Button Version 2">
                    <p>Original Wireframe</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src="/desktop-dash-v1-opt.png" alt="Desktop Dashboard Options Button Version 2">
                    <p>Original Wireframe</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src="/desktop-dash-wireframe-fab.png" alt="Desktop Dashboard Floating Action Button Version 1">
                    <p>Original Wireframe</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src="/desktop-dash-wireframe-opt.png" alt="Desktop Dashboard Options Button Version 1">
                    <p>Original Wireframe</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Since the “Add New” button still didn’t give all the users confidence they needed to take action, I updated the label to “Add New File” to be as specific as possible.</p>

        <section>
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>Creating this app was a really valuable experience. The thing I found most helpful during this process was multiple rounds of testing. Having testers that were not accustomed to using cloud drives turned out to be a big bonus - their experiences
                highlighted issues I might not have otherwise thought of, and reminded me that even if you’re using common design patterns, you can always make things a little more clear.</p>
            <p>Cirrus solves a big problem for cloud users by offering a way for users to efficiently access all of their files in one place, saving them time and cognitive effort. Users no longer have to ask themselves, “Where did I save that file?” - with
                Cirrus, it’s simple.</p>
