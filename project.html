                    <p>With so many cloud storage platforms on the market, cloud storage users are frustrated when they have to navigate between several cloud drives to find the file they are looking for.</p>
                    <h1 class="heading-4">Solution</h1>
                    <p>Cirrus brings all of a user’s cloud drives into one easy to access location. The user can search across all drives, upload files to a specific drive, share files, and edit files in the native platform, removing the need to navigate
                        back and forth between drives.</p>

                    <p>A clickable prototype was created from the digital wireframes, and tested with users before going too far down any design path. Users were given three tasks to complete: creating an account, uploading a file, and organizing that file
                        into a different folder.
                    </p>
                    <p>This round of testing helped me realize that because some of the users weren’t familiar with cloud storage apps, they also weren’t familiar with common design patterns used such as the Material Design Floating Action Button (FAB).</p>
                    <p>During the desktop test, users weren’t confident about:</p>
                    <ul class="text-list">
                        <li>Where the sidebar navigation links would take them and where they currently were
                        </li>
                        <li>What the FAB was for
                        </li>
                        <li>What the tridot button was for
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After this feedback, I was able to rethink components and make them more clear to the users.</p>

                    <p>The final logomark is created from several circles that connect together to form a cloud, mirroring how the app will connect user drives to create one cohesive experience. The cloud shape is not that of a traditional Cirrus cloud,
                        but gives a nod to the symbol traditionally used for cloud-based apps.</p>

                    <p>Creating this app was a really valuable experience. The thing I found most helpful during this process was multiple rounds of testing. Having testers that were not accustomed to using cloud drives turned out to be a big bonus - their
                        experiences highlighted issues I might not have otherwise thought of, and reminded me that even if you’re using common design patterns, you can always make things a little more clear.</p>
                    <p>Cirrus solves a big problem for cloud users by offering a way for users to efficiently access all of their files in one place, saving them time and cognitive effort. Users no longer have to ask themselves, “Where did I save that file?”
                        - with Cirrus, it’s simple.</p>
